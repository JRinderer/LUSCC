Notes on Assembly and GDB

Using this simple Assembly program we'll learn to debug Assembly:

global _start

section .text

_start:
    mov rax, 5
    mov rbx, 8
    add rax, rbx

    mov rax, 1
    int 0x80


the following starts the GDB system
    gdb -q -tui ./out


once in GDB let's set our assembly flavor to Intel
    set disassembly-flavor intel

set a break point on _start
    break _start


show the layout of assembly
    layout asm

show the layout of the registers:
    show regs


Start stepping:
    step i
